Accurately measuring for your <a href="https://auunique.co.uk/">Auunique radiator cover</a> is crucial for ensuring a perfect fit for your new radiator cover. Follow this comprehensive guide to obtain the correct measurements and choose the ideal custom radiator cabinet for your space.

## Essential Measurements for Radiator Covers

**Width**  
Measure the total width of your radiator, including any valves or pipes. Add an extra 20mm to this measurement to allow for proper fit and ventilation.

**Height**  
Measure from the floor to the top of your radiator. For the cover height, add 90-100mm to this measurement to accommodate the top board.

**Depth**  
Measure from the wall to the front of your radiator, including any protruding parts. Add 20-30mm to this measurement for the cover depth.

## Additional Considerations for Custom Radiator Cabinets

**Skirting Boards**  
If your radiator sits in front of a skirting board, measure its height and depth. This information is crucial for ensuring a proper fit against the wall.
