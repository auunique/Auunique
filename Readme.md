Follow this comprehensive guide to obtain the correct measurements and choose the ideal cover for your space.
Essential Measurements
Width
Measure the total width of your radiator, including any valves or pipes. Add an extra 20mm to this measurement to allow for proper fit and ventilation.
Height
Measure from the floor to the top of your radiator. For the cover height, add 90-100mm to this measurement to accommodate the top board.
Depth
Measure from the wall to the front of your radiator, including any protruding parts. Add 20-30mm to this measurement for the cover depth.
Additional Considerations
Skirting Boards
If your radiator sits in front of a skirting board, measure its height and depth. This information is crucial for ensuring a proper fit against the wall.
Pipe Locations
Note the positions of pipes entering and exiting your radiator. This helps in determining if you need a slotted bottom board or pipe collars.
Wall Type
Consider whether your wall is solid or has a dado rail, as this may affect the cover design.
Ordering Process

The team will review your measurements and contact you if any clarifications are needed.
